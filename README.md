# powers

This is a minimal working example of my first R package for STAT 545!

THe goal of powers is to easily compute common powers of numeric data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of powers like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zoehorlick/powers")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(powers)
## basic example code

square(1)
#> [1] 1

square(c(1,2,3,4))
#> [1]  1  4  9 16
```
